# Corvallis Bus Routes

This website is a prototype of a web app that provides Corvallis residents with helpful information to plan their commute using the Corvallis Transit System buses. It displays route information, allows users to save favorite stops to easily check when buses are arriving, and gives a simple summary of the current weather conditions.

## View Favorite Stops

**Please Note:**
This was created as a group final project for a web development course and is not fully fleshed out, nor optimized for mobile devices. Currently, there are no user accounts as this was outside the scope of this course, so favorite stops are not persisted after closing the website.
